Inspired by the default version of [Material Theme](http://equinsuocha.io/material-theme/) for Sublime Text

**Note: This theme works only with [Brackets](http://brackets.io/)**

## Requirements
The theme works best if the following extensions are installed as well
  * [Brackets UI Theming Enable](https://github.com/notasz/brackets-uitheming) (to style UI elements, like the sidebar, toolbar etc.)
  * [Brackets Icons](https://github.com/ivogabe/Brackets-Icons) (for file icons in the sidebar)
  * [Color Highlighter](https://github.com/Taraflex/Brackets-Color-Highlighter) (Color highlighter for CSS, LESS, SCSS, SASS and Stylus)

## Installation
  * **Using Brackets' Extension Manager (recommended)**
    1. Open the Extension Manager dialog *(File -> Extension Manager)*, or click the LEGO block icon in the right sidebar
	2. Search for `Material Theme [Brackets]` and click the install button
	3. Close the dialog after installation completes and reload Brackets with extensions ( <kbd>F5</kbd> )
  * **Manual**
    1. [Download](https://github.com/adhirajsinghchauhan/Material-Theme-Brackets/releases/download/v1.2.0/material-theme-brackets.zip) and extract the ZIP file to the extension folder location *(Help -> Show Extensions Folder)*
