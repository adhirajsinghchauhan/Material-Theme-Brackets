Inspired by the default version of [Material Theme](https://github.com/equinusocio/material-theme) for Sublime Text

**Note: This theme works only with [Brackets](http://brackets.io/)**

  * [Brackets Icons](https://github.com/ivogabe/Brackets-Icons) (for file icons in the sidebar)
  * [Color Highlighter](https://github.com/Taraflex/Brackets-Color-Highlighter) (Color highlighter for CSS, LESS, SCSS, SASS and Stylus)

  * **Using Brackets' Extension Manager (recommended)**
    1. Open the Extension Manager dialog *(File -> Extension Manager)*, or click the LEGO block icon in the right sidebar
	2. Search for `Material Theme [Brackets]` and click the install button
	3. Close the dialog after installation completes and reload Brackets with extensions ( <kbd>F5</kbd> )
  * **Manual**
